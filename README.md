### Webscraping: BCCR dollar exchange rate extraction
[Repo](https://github.com/lemilosm/bccr_dollar_exch_rate_hist_webscr)

The Central Bank of Costa Rica website provides daily updates on USD/CRC from a page.

The page also offers the option of exporting a file of the daily exchange history since 1983-01-01.

The objective of this project is to produce a file that contains the most up to date CRC/USD exchange rate, that can later be used in other data science projects, as input data, for example as a new column, merging it to other tables/dataframes using the date index.
